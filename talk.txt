First time at the famous NYC meetup

Meetups are awesome:
  You learn, eat, get insipred, play bingo

Kinda annoying though:
  People show off really cool stuff you can't use

Kinda like Hacker News, really awesome things available if you live in the exact 2 blocks in SF where the founders live

There is only one thing worse than having to watch people show off new cool things:
  Having access to cool new things and then having it taken away - Firefly

Its like flying business class

Ember Cli Migrator
Today's technology today

Alpha software

Not a live demo! - I am not a masochist
What we can do:
  1. Migrate a class
  2. Figure out Ember/Ember data imports
  3. Figure out App imports
  4. Split multiple files

How does it work?

Left to do:
  1. Interactivity
  2. Fully migrated app

Thanks!
