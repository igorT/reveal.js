Hello, my name is Igor
Weather, excited to be here
Talk about 1.0
Horrible idea
Somewhere between when I
Bold move
Why it's just a number
Shutter island
We have shipped, and I am very excited
But first, lets retrospect

-Were/history(history joke?)

Ever since the dawn of time?
Started in 2011
Ember is older
Ember had benefit of sproutcore,
Ember Data was early
Glimmer of hope

Why do version numbers matter:
  1. They don't
  2. Communicate which version
  3. Marketing
  4. SemVer

Dev cycles:
  1. Red green refactor
  2. Big bang release with patches
  3. Ask Linus and hope he doesn't smite you with his anger
  4. Tick Tock
